== PROJECT: ZeroToOne


== Overview

ZeroToOne is a desktop application that serves as an all-in-one exercise tracker and personal aide. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 26 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Workout Session Feature*
** What it does: Allows the user to start a workout session by providing a `WORKOUT_ID`.
The session keeps track of the user's workout by providing a queue of upcoming sets and the progress of the previous set.
The session also includes a rest timer that helps users keep to their workout schedule between sets.
** Justification: This feature is a core feature within the app. It helps users keep to their workouts and ensures that even the most tired user will not forget any exercise during a workout session.
** Highlights: This feature required major design consideration in order to maintain a bug-free, stateful representation of a workout session, with a user-facing experience that automatically logs completed sessions.

* *Major enhancement*: added the *Rest Timer Feature*
** What it does: Seamlessly integrated with the *Workout Session Feature*, the timer helps users keep to their workout schedule and times rest between sets.
** Justification: Helps users manage their workout session and keep to their rest time for an optimal workout.
** Highlights: This feature requires the use of a thread to update the clock.
Major design consideration was required to ensure that the timer was not computationally expensive yet reliable, and that the feature was user-facing and integrated with the session feature seamlessly.
